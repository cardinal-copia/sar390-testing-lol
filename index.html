    <h1>[A MESSAGE FROM THE CLERGY]</h1>
    <p>We wish to inform you that pumpkins have began to sprout in Papa Emeritus I's gardens. He is opening his greenhouse's doors to the congregation to partake in pumpkin picking, so please stop by if you are interested. Two pumpkins maximum per Sibling, please keep your pumpkins away from the Ghouls.</p>
    <p>In other news, Papa Emeritus III is hosting a <a href="https://google.com">Halloween party</a> with prizes being offered for best costume. Admission is free, though donations to the Ministry are accepted. Please RSVP to one of Papa Emeritus III's Ghouls or to Papa himself no later than October 5th.</p>
